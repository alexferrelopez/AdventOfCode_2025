# Advent of Code 2025

This repository contains my solutions to Advent of Code, a yearly December coding challenge created by Eric Wastl.
The event runs for 12 days, with puzzles that increase in complexity each day and can be solved in any programming language.

Inputs are not included in this repository, following the official guidelines.
